# Brain Tumor Detection (End-to-End)

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a **Flask web application** for detecting **brain tumors** from MRI images using a deep learning model built with **PyTorch**. Users can upload MRI images through the app, and the model will classify them as either **tumor** or **non-tumor**. The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive interface for medical professionals to quickly identify potential brain tumors.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains **MRI images**, divided into two categories: **tumor** and **non-tumor**.
- **Preprocessing techniques** are applied to the dataset to ensure optimal model performance.

## 🏗 Project Overview
This end-to-end project consists of:
1. **Data Loading**: Load MRI images for training, validation, and testing.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Apply normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques.
3. **Model Building**: Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using PyTorch to classify MRI images.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model on GPU (if available) to detect brain tumors.
5. **Flask Web Application**: Develop a **Flask app** for user interaction, allowing image uploads for tumor detection.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model within the Flask app.
7. **Prediction**: Provide real-time predictions through the **Flask web app**.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for this project.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download the Pretrained Model
Download the pretrained model from this link and place it in the `model/` directory as `brain_tumor_model.pth`.

### Step 4: Running the Flask App
To start the **Flask web app**, navigate to the `app/` directory and run the `app.py` file:
```bash
cd app/
python app.py
```
The app will be hosted at **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**. Open the URL in your browser and upload MRI images to receive predictions.

## 🎨 Flask Web Application Features
- **🖼 Image Upload**: Users can upload MRI images through the web interface.
- **🔬 Tumor Detection**: The uploaded image is fed into the model to predict whether a tumor is present.
- **📋 Result Display**: The result is displayed on the same page with either a "Tumor" or "Non-Tumor" label.

## 🏗 Model Architecture
The model used in this project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using **PyTorch**. The architecture has been optimized for **image classification tasks** and consists of several layers:

### 🔑 Key Layers:
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from MRI images.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: For downsampling and reducing spatial dimensions.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.
- **Softmax Activation**: To produce the output probability of each class (**Tumor/Non-Tumor**).

## 📊 Data Preprocessing
To ensure the **CNN model** performs optimally, the following preprocessing steps are applied:
- **🖤 Grayscale Conversion**: All MRI images are converted to grayscale.
- **📏 Resizing**: Images are resized to **64x64 pixels** for uniformity.
- **📉 Normalization**: Each pixel value is normalized to a range of **[0, 1]**.
- **🌀 Data Augmentation**: Techniques like random rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to expand the dataset and prevent overfitting.

## 🔍 Conclusion
This **Flask web app** provides an **end-to-end solution** for detecting **brain tumors** using MRI images. With a simple **user interface** and a powerful **backend**, it can serve as a **diagnostic tool** for medical professionals. The project can be further enhanced by:

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
✅ **Integration with Cloud Platforms**: Deploy the app on **Heroku** or **AWS** for wider accessibility.  
✅ **Mobile Application**: Develop a **mobile app** to upload MRI images and get predictions on the go.  
✅ **Transfer Learning**: Incorporate pre-trained models like **ResNet** to further improve accuracy.
